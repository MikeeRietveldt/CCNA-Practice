This repository contains my hands-on practice labs as I work toward earning my **Cisco CCNA certification**.

## 📚 Study Resources

- Configuration practice for:
  - Routing & switching
  - VLANs & trunking
  - IP addressing & subnetting
  - NAT, ACLs, and basic security
  - WAN and internet connectivity concepts

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Reinforce CCNA concepts through hands-on practice
- Track my learning progress over time
- Build a solid networking foundation using real-world-style labs

## 🚧 Notes

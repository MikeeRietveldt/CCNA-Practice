## 📦 Packet Tracer (.pkt) Files

If you have trouble opening a downloaded `.pkt` file, it’s usually due to how the file was downloaded from GitHub.

### ✅ How to fix it
1. Click the `.pkt` file in the repository.  
2. Click RAW (do NOT use “Save page as” or download the page).
3. Save the file and open it with Cisco Packet Tracer.

Using RAW ensures you download the actual `.pkt` file instead of an HTML file.  
This fixes 99% of Packet Tracer file issues.
